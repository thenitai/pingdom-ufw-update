# pingdom-ufw-update
This is a simple bash script that updates the firewall (ufw) automatically.

## Usage
Simply grab the script and put it on your server (I like to use /opt). Give the script executable permission and run it.

For a contact updated firewall you can use cron to run the script every 24 hours or so.
